# Thesis Template
By Tommi Heikkil√§

### LaTeX template file for creating an okay-ish PhD Thesis (or similar)

The template attempts to explain most of its extra functionality.

A lot of code is copied or otherwise sourced from the extremely helpful TeX StackExchange and I have tried to leave links to the original sources.

### Is it any good?

You be the judge. My thesis is available in the University of Helsinki thesis repository Helda: http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-51-9685-9
